# Zsh Configuration

## Zsh and Oh My Zsh

As a shell, I'm using [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).

Paired with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), it becomes very powerful with strong plugins.

## Theme

For a better-looking terminal, I am using [Power Level 10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k).

![P10K Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k-media/master/prompt-styles-high-contrast.png)

It has many cool features and designs available, fully customizable.

Feel free to use my personal theme or setup your own by following the installation steps in the repository.
