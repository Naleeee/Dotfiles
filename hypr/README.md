## Description

I am currently using hyprland as my window tile manager since it is modern, good looking, easy to configure and highly customizable.

It is easily configurable and offers a lot of tools using official tools or user based ones like a navbar, lockscreen and much more.

## Theme

Since Catppucin is my current neovim theme, I wanted to keep the same style within my global dev environment, this is why I used most of the themes and config in [this Typecraft video](https://youtu.be/omhJMH9lPPc?si=DLqEkNhRDueGhdnL).

## Hyprlock

[Hyprlock](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprlock/) is a lock screen for wayland, it is a simple lock screen that uses the same theme as the rest of the system.
By using [hypridle](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hypridle/), which detect afk.time, I am locking my screen after 5 minutes of inactivity.

## Hyprpaper

[Hyprpaper](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Hypr-Ecosystem/hyprpaper/) is my wallpaper manager. I have set it up to handle multiple wallpapers on specific screens.
