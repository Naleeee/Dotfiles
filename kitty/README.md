# Kitty

![Kitty preview](./docs/assets/KittyPreview.png)

## Description

I am currently using Kitty as terminal since it is a modern, feature-rich terminal emulator designed to enhance the user experience for developers and power users.

It is easily configurable and supports a lot of important features like Unicode support of True Color as well.

## Theme

Since Catppucin is my current neovim theme, I wanted to keep the same style within my terminal, this is why I am using the [Catppuccin theme](https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty) in my terminal as well.
